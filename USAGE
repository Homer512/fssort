fssort works as a standard input/standard output filter similar to e.g. sort.
It reads a list of file and directory names from standard input and writes a
reordered list to standard output.

A simple application would be
find /source -type f | fssort | cpio -pd /destination
which copies all ordinary files in /source to /destination

fssort can only handle a limited number of filesystems (at the moment Ext2-4).
It also typically requires root permissions to access the filesystems. Files on
other filesystems or missing permissions are handled gracefully. Those files are
written directly to standard output.

Note that fssort does not treat directories differently from files. This means a
directory may appear in the output after the files it contains. For example if
you wish to use fssort with tar, do it like this
find /source | fssort | tar -c -T - --no-recursion -f destination.tar
